# GenMap

## TODO

[ ] Support sprites
[X] Make loading an asset more generic so a sprite or studio model can also be the asset loaded from arguments
[ ] Shade the models from their environment (find the closest face and extract an average color from its lightmap)
[ ] Make the code base compile on linux (see older opengl projects for example code)
